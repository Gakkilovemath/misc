## Introduction

This repository contains miscellaneous files which I've created. Hopefully you might find some of them useful!

1. **fundsupermart.py**: Takes a list of mutual fund codes and pulls their prices from fundsupermart's website.

2. **correlation.py**: A Tkinter programme I used to help me understand various correlation metrics better.
